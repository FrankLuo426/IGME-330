# Audio-1

## Terms

- Sound Waves:
  - Compression
  - Rarefaction
  - Longitudinal Waves
  - Frequency - the number of waves emitted or received in one second (the human ear can detect between 16Hz to 16kHz)
  - wavelength
  - amplitude
  - reflection
  - diffraction
- Digital Sound:
  - File Types
  - The three audio formats used for HTML 5: MP3, WAV, and OGG Vorbis. These are all encoded audio formats (i.e., the raw samples of an audio waveform are compressed to take up less space). All of these formats use *perceptual encoding*, which means they throw away audio data information that is not typically perceived by humans
  - sampling - A sample is a snapshot of a waveform sampled at fixed intervals (CDs are sampled 44,100 times per second i.e. 44.1kHz
  - quantizing
  - bit depth
  - FFT 
- Web Audio:
  - Audio Source
  - Audio Destination
  - Audio Filter:
    - Real-time frequency analysis to determine the composition of a sound
    - Frequency filters to extract certain frequency regions.
  - Audio Routing Graph
